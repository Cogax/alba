Tooling for better integration testing against ASP.Net Core applications. Also an alternative routing engine based on the Trie algorithm just for fun.

To get started with the code, you'll need at least the dotnet CLI version 1.0.1 to work with the code. Assuming that you've got VS2015 or above, just open the solution
at src/Alba.sln and go to town.

At this point, we're keeping Alba back on the project.json project format until VS2017 has stabilized.
